# **UX Portfolio**
###### These are my up-to-date user interface/experience creations.

## **osu! skin**
###### osu! is a free to play and open source rhythm game available on PC. A skin for this game is basically an overlay for their default UI while retaining the same features and playablity. I used Adobe Photoshop to make the still images and Adobe After Effects to animate some portions about a year or two ago.

###### Note: These main menu pictures come directly from the png files used because I do not have osu! supporter anymore, which allowed these to be displayed in game. The actual interface has the osu! logo overlayed ontop, with the osu! direct side menu text overlay, as indicated by the rounded rectangle on the side. I previously received supporter as compensation for a commission that I did for a custom skin, but I deleted the project files for that after.

###### Note: All the information about how the song was played and the score achieved on it is displayed on this screen. Also, the circle object is the cursor that I made for my skin, with the cursor trail.

###### I posted this skin for download on reddit and these are a few of the comments that I received.

## **Profile Picture**
###### This is image that I made for myself around a year ago by using a devil character as a base. I changed up the colors and other layer styles using photoshop to make it look a little cooler. I also created a custom font to go along with the picture.

# **UX Portfolio**
These are my up-to-date user interface/experience creations.

## **osu! skin**
osu! is a free to play and open source rhythm game available on PC. A skin for this game is basically an overlay for their default UI while retaining the same features and playablity. I used Adobe Photoshop to make the still images and Adobe After Effects to animate some portions.

Note: These main menu pictures come directly from the png files used because I do not have osu! supporter anymore, which allows these particular images to be displayed in game.. The actual interface has the osu! logo overlayed ontop, with the osu! direct sidemenu text overlay, as indicated by the rounded rectangle on the side.
